1. Download the MAX patch for the server (ava√¨lable [here](https://github.com/qualified-self/cue-control/tree/master/maxmsp%20server/version%202));

2. Everything should be running fine by now. You can make sure the system is properly working by using the controls inside the [p osc-send-simulator] object.
