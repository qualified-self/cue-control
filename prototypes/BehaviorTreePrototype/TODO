High priority:
[ ] BlackboardRamp problem: try creating a node "blackboard-ramp test 0 1 10.0" (does not work)
[ ] Chrono problem: it is not restarted when resetting
[ ] Text problem: try "text 1000"
[ ] Add auto-save
[ ] Prevent scrolling too much such that text disappears
[x] Add copy-cut-paste option
[x] CTRL-DEL is not working
[x] Tab in autocomplete should complete common prefixes
[x] Autocomplete list should be selectable using arrows (and/or mouse)
[x] Allow erasing the root node (all of this would be highly facilitated by simply adding a RootNode that takes a single child).
[x] Add a help button
[x] Integrate tasks for tracking keyPressed, mouseX and mouseY
[x] Fix bug: bad support for javascript expressions when it comes to text (string) variables eg. while "$key !== 'a'" does not work

Mid priority:
[x] Add a button to "comment out" (ie. activate/deactivate) a node / decorator
[x] Add colors to the console (notice/log, warning, error)
[ ] Bring all colors in a single file as constants
