High priority:
[ ] CTRL-DEL is not working
[x] Tab in autocomplete should complete common prefixes
[x] Autocomplete list should be selectable using arrows (and/or mouse)
[x] Allow erasing the root node (all of this would be highly facilitated by simply adding a RootNode that takes a single child).
[ ] Add a help button
[ ] Integrate tasks for tracking keyPressed, mouseX and mouseY

Mid priority:
[ ] Add a button to "comment out" (ie. activate/deactivate) a node / decorator
[x] Add colors to the console (notice/log, warning, error)
[ ] Bring all colors in a single file as constants
